# CIFAR-10-Classification
Creating a README file for your model on GitHub is a good practice to provide documentation and information about your project. Here's a basic template for your README file:

# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Model

## Overview
This repository contains code for a CIFAR-10 image classification model implemented using TensorFlow and scikit-learn. The model can predict the class of an image from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which includes ten different classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using `pip`:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is used for this project. It is divided into a training set and a test set. You can load the dataset using TensorFlow's `keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()`.

## Model Training
The model is trained using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and an ensemble model that combines Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and KNN classifiers. You can find the training code in the repository.

## Model Evaluation
The accuracy of the models is evaluated on both the training and test datasets using scikit-learn's `accuracy_score` function.

## Usage
You can use this model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset or other similar datasets. To make predictions, follow the code provided in the repository. The model predicts the class of an image and returns the class label and name.
